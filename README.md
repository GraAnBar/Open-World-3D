# SDEV248-Open-World-3D-Pip-s-Adventure
 This is the godot project for the Open World 3D assignment. It does not meet all of the criteria for the assignment but I do hope it meets good expectations.
I really enjoyed working on this and learning how to creat a 3D world since I have mostly been making 2D games most of this class time. It was a great learning experience and I am open to taking any grade I get for this assignment since I am missing the enemies, item, and teleporting function. Most likely a bit more but I wanted to include songs as well from my favorite game.

All Nier Automata songs belong to Square Enix.
